## About ASD and ACSC

The Minister for Defence is responsible for the [Australian Signals Directorate](https://www.asd.gov.au/about)  (ASD), which is a vital member of Australia’s national security community. ASD works across the full spectrum of operations required of contemporary signals intelligence and security agencies: intelligence, cyber security and offensive operations in support of the Australian Government and Australian Defence Force (ADF).

The [Australian Cyber Security Centre](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/about-asd-acsc/who-we-are) (ACSC) sits within ASD and leads the Government’s efforts on national cyber security. It brings together cyber security capabilities from across the Australian Government, including Department of Home Affairs, Australian Federal Police (AFP), ASIO, Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission (ACIC), ADF and the [Defence Intelligence Organisation](http://www.defence.gov.au/dio/index.shtml), to improve the cyber resilience of the Australian community and help make Australia the most secure place to connect online.

The [ACSC Partnership Program](https://www.cyber.gov.au/partner-hub/acsc-partnership-program), delivered through centres in Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney, brings together partners from government, critical infrastructure, business and academia to enhance collaboration on cyber security. The centres are a critical hub for improving cyber security practices and share information in a trusted and secure environment.
