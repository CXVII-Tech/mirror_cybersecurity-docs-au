## **Introduction**

The Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) has developed prioritised mitigation strategies, in the form of the [*Strategies to mitigate cybersecurity incidents*](https://www.cyber.gov.au/business-government/asds-cyber-security-frameworks/mitigating-cyber-security-incidents), to help organisations protect themselves against various cyberthreats. The most effective of these mitigation strategies are the Essential Eight.

The [*Essential Eight maturity model*](https://www.cyber.gov.au/business-government/asds-cyber-security-frameworks/essential-eight), first published in June 2017 and updated regularly, supports the implementation of the Essential Eight. It is based on ASD’s experience in producing cyberthreat intelligence, responding to cybersecurity incidents, conducting penetration testing and assisting organisations to implement the Essential Eight.

This publication provides a mapping between the [*Essential Eight maturity model*](https://www.cyber.gov.au/business-government/asds-cyber-security-frameworks/essential-eight) and the [*Information security manual*](https://www.cyber.gov.au/business-government/asds-cyber-security-frameworks/ism) (ISM).

## **Further information**

The [*Information security manual*](https://www.cyber.gov.au/business-government/asds-cyber-security-frameworks/ism) is a cybersecurity framework that organisations can apply to protect their systems and data from cyberthreats. The advice in the [*Strategies to mitigate cybersecurity incidents*](https://www.cyber.gov.au/business-government/asds-cyber-security-frameworks/mitigating-cyber-security-incidents), along with its [Essential Eight](https://www.cyber.gov.au/business-government/asds-cyber-security-frameworks/essential-eight), complements this framework.
