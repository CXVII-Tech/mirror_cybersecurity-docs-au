## **Introduction**

The Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) has developed prioritised mitigation strategies, in the form of the [*Strategies to mitigate cybersecurity incidents*](https://www.cyber.gov.au/business-government/asds-cyber-security-frameworks/mitigating-cyber-security-incidents), to help organisations protect themselves against various cyberthreats. The most effective of these mitigation strategies are the Essential Eight.

The Essential Eight has been designed to protect organisations’ internet-connected information technology networks. While the principles behind the Essential Eight may be applied to enterprise mobility and operational technology networks, it was not designed for such purposes and alternative mitigation strategies may be more appropriate to defend against unique cyberthreats to these environments.

The [*Essential Eight maturity model*](https://www.cyber.gov.au/business-government/asds-cyber-security-frameworks/essential-eight/essential-eight-maturity-model), first published in June 2017 and updated regularly, supports the implementation of the Essential Eight. It is based on ASD’s experience in producing cyberthreat intelligence, responding to cybersecurity incidents, conducting penetration testing and assisting organisations to implement the Essential Eight.

## **The Essential Eight**

The mitigation strategies that constitute the Essential Eight are:

- patch applications
- patch operating systems
- multi-factor authentication
- restrict administrative privileges
- application control
- restrict Microsoft Office macros
- user application hardening
- regular backups.

## **Implementing the Essential Eight**

The [*Essential Eight maturity model*](https://www.cyber.gov.au/business-government/asds-cyber-security-frameworks/essential-eight/essential-eight-maturity-model) articulates requirements for the implementation of the Essential Eight.

## **Assessing implementations of the Essential Eight**

Assessments against the Essential Eight should be conducted using the [*Essential Eight assessment process guide*](https://www.cyber.gov.au/business-government/asds-cyber-security-frameworks/essential-eight/essential-eight-assessment-process-guide).

## **Further information**

Further information on the [*Essential Eight maturity model*](https://www.cyber.gov.au/business-government/asds-cyber-security-frameworks/essential-eight/essential-eight-maturity-model) and its implementation is available in the [*Essential Eight maturity model FAQ*](https://www.cyber.gov.au/business-government/asds-cyber-security-frameworks/essential-eight/essential-eight-maturity-model-faq) publication.
