## **Essential Eight Assessment Course, a collaboration with TAFEcyber**

The Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) is committed to providing technical advice and assistance that helps strengthen the cybersecurity posture and resilience of industry and government organisations. As part of this commitment, ASD has developed the Essential Eight Assessment Course and partnered with TAFEcyber who will deliver the course across Australia.

The Essential Eight Assessment Course will help cyber and ICT professionals:

- understand the intent and application of the Essential Eight
- learn how to use ASD designed tools
- accurately test the implementation of the Essential Eight
- define an action plan to address any weaknesses.

The Essential Eight Assessment Course will be a face-to-face three-day course that uses a blend of specialist expertise, knowledge and hands-on technical training. It will teach participants how to conduct accurate and consistent Essential Eight assessments, and practically apply the [Essential Eight Assessment Process Guide](https://www.cyber.gov.au/business-government/asds-cyber-security-frameworks/essential-eight/essential-eight-assessment-process-guide).
