# Executive summary

Instruction: Provide a one-to-two-page overview of the assessment including:

- brief background on the entity and system being assessed
- assessment scope, approach and limitations
- summary of Essential Eight maturity
- summary of key security risks and positive findings identified during the assessment
- summary of key recommendations to remediate security risks and/or achieve the target maturity level.

# Introduction

## Background

Instruction: As appropriate, provide a one-to-two-page introduction to the Essential Eight, the entity and their operating environment, their cybersecurity strategy, and any recent cybersecurity uplift activities or prior Essential Eight assessments.

## Scope

Instruction: Detail the system under assessment (including the system boundary and any exclusions), the version of the Essential Eight being used and the target maturity level.

## Approach

Instruction: Detail the approach used to assess the system including:

- qualitative and quantitative techniques used for testing security controls
- sampling technique and rationale for sample sizes
- specific tools used during the assessment, such as scripts and vulnerability scanning tools.

## Limitations

Instruction: Detail any assessment limitations, for example, availability of information, resources or technical testing constraints.

# Detailed findings

## Patch applications

**Findings**

Instruction: Provide comments on the assessment of the mitigation strategy’s implementation including:
