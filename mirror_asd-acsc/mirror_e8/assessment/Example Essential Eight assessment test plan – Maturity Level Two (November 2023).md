| **Mitigation Strategy** | **Test ID** | **Control Description** | **Test Methodology** | **Test Findings** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Patch applications** | ML2-PA-01 | A vulnerability scanner is used at least fortnightly to identify missing patches or updates for vulnerabilities in applications other than office productivity suites, web browsers and their extensions, email clients, PDF software, and security products. | Observe a vulnerability scan, or request evidence of previous vulnerability scans, and note the date/time stamp and scope. Check whether the list of scanned applications includes the list of applications that should have been scanned. |  |
|  | ML2-PA-02 | Patches, updates or other vendor mitigations for vulnerabilities in applications other than office productivity suites, web browsers and their extensions, email clients, PDF software, and security products are applied within one month of release. | Use a vulnerability scanner to identify the listed applications within the environment. Check the date applications were updated and compare to the dates patches were released. Check that the gap between is not greater than one month. |  |

Note, hash-based and publisher-based approaches are system-wide and automatically meet the intent of this control. |  |
|  | ML2-AC-03 | Microsoft’s recommended application blocklist is implemented. | Attempt to run a binary that is on the recommended application blocklist such as mshta.exe, wmic.exe or wscript.exe. |  |
|  |  |  | E8MVT will retrieve the latest version of the blocklist from Microsoft. It will compare each of the rules against those configured on the system and return a failed result if any do not match. This will not consider any rules that are determined to be necessary for business purposes and are risk managed. |  |
|  | ML2-AC-04 | Application control rulesets are validated on an annual or more frequent basis. | Check that the organisation has a process for reviewing the list of allowed applications on an annual or more frequent basis. |  |

|  | ML2-AH-09 | PDF software is hardened using ASD and vendor hardening guidance, with the most restrictive guidance taking precedence when conflicts occur. | Determine the PDF software in use and if the vendor provides hardening guidance for that product. Follow the guidance to determine if the product has been hardened. |  |

|  | ML2-AH-11 | PowerShell module logging, script block logging and transcription events are centrally logged. | E8MVT is able to check the registry settings for this control. |  |
|  |  |  | Alternatively, within the RSoP report, look for the *Turn on Module Logging*, *Turn on PowerShell Script Block Logging* and *Turn on PowerShell Transcription* settings at *Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Windows PowerShell*. They should all be enabled. In addition, module logging should ideally be configured to log all modules (i.e. ‘*’), although an organisation may tailor this setting. |  |
|  |  |  | Finally, determine if these event logs are being centrally stored. |  |
|  | ML2-AH-12 | Command line process creation events are centrally logged. | E8MVT is able to check the registry settings for this control. |  |

It should be enabled with a value of *Success*. In addition, look for the *Include command line in process creation events* setting at *Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\System\Audit Process Creation*. It should be enabled. |  |
|  |  |  | Finally, determine if these event logs are being centrally stored. |  |
