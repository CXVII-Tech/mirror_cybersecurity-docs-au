# A mirror of [Essential Eight (E8)](https://github.com/CXVII-Tech/cybersecurity-docs-au/tree/main/asd-acsc/downloads/asd-e8)

While no set of mitigation strategies are guaranteed to protect against all cyberthreats, organisations are recommended to implement eight essential mitigation strategies from the [Strategies to mitigate cybersecurity incidents](https://github.com/CXVII-Tech/mirror_cybersecurity-docs-au/tree/asd-acsc-md/mirror_asd-acsc/mirror_strategy-mitigate) as a baseline. This baseline, known as the [Essential Eight](https://www.cyber.gov.au/business-government/asds-cyber-security-frameworks/essential-eight), makes it much harder for adversaries to compromise systems.
