ASD endorses ICT training providers to develop and facilitate IRAP New Starter Training.

## IRAP new starter training and examination

ASD has approved the following providers to develop and present the IRAP New Starter Training. Providers work closely with ASD and have experience in ICT security and the delivery of ICT training. You have the choice of either:

- [Australian Cyber Collaboration Centre](https://www.cybercollaboration.org.au/irap)
- [CIT Solutions- Transformation through learning](https://citsolutions.edu.au/courses/at_work/cyber_security/Infosec_Registered_Assessors_Program_IRAP)

The IRAP New Starter course assumes learners have experience in ICT and security assessments. This includes experience in Australian Government ICT policy including:

- [*Information Security Manual*](https://www.cyber.gov.au/business-government/asds-cyber-security-frameworks/ism) (ISM)
- [*Protective Security Policy Framework*](https://www.protectivesecurity.gov.au/) (PSPF)

The course explains how to use both of these policies in conducting IRAP Assessments. Exam results are valid for 12 months from the date of assessment. Learners can [apply to become IRAP assessors](https://www.cyber.gov.au/business-government/protecting-devices-systems/assessment-evaluation-programs/irap/application-form) in this time.
