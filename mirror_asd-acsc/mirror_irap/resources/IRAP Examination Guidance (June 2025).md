# IRAP Examination Guidance (June 2025)

## Introduction

### Notes for participants

The InfoSec Registered Assessors Program (IRAP) examination has been designed to test the collective skills and experience expected of an IRAP assessor.

Participants undertaking this course are required to have extensive professional experience of Australian Government Frameworks, such as the Australian Government Information Security Manual (ISM) and Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF), to secure or assess systems. As such, participants should expect to draw on this experience to pass the exam and not rely solely on the knowledge gained though this course.

### Overview

The IRAP examination is not a learning exercise and is not meant to teach participants to be an IRAP assessor. It is a test designed to support an application for endorsement and verifies a participant’s judgement, reasoning and ability to make assessments and recommendations for improving information security. This will be based upon existing knowledge of general information security principles, work experience, IRAP processes and procedures, and relevant Australian Government policy and information security guidelines, with a focus on the ISM, the PSPF, and other Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) technical publications.

The IRAP training reinforces core knowledge and expectations around applying the ISM, *IRAP Policy and Procedures*, and the *IRAP Common Assessment Framework*.

### Required reading

For examination purposes, where there is an incongruity between ASD publications and the course material, the publications should be considered the authoritative source, unless specified by the ASD-endorsed training provider or ASD IRAP.

To ensure the most success in passing the IRAP examination, course participants must be familiar with the following publications and documents. All publications are available on the internet on the cyber.gov.au website - [Resources for business and government | Cyber.gov.au](https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government).

### Expected skills of an IRAP assessor

IRAP assessors are expected to have the following skills and knowledge: 

**to understand:**

- understand and identify information security principles
- understand and adhere to conflict of interest policies
- understand and apply the intent of the ISM to systems and services
- understand quality of evidence definitions and aim for the best evidence available for a given control
- understand ICT risk management to be able to recognise and suggest remediation, to potentially vulnerable situations.

**to explain:**

- describe how information security principles can be integrated into ICT systems
- discuss ethical issues involved in providing information security services to Australian Government and Industry
- explain how applying specific information security controls will benefit an organisation
- explain, coherently and logically, why specific information security controls are recommended
- evaluate the implementation of security controls.

**to demonstrate:**

- demonstrate the communication skills needed for requirements-gathering, development and implementation of information security controls and their appropriate evaluation
- gather requirements for the process of implementing information security advice
- design information security advice
- demonstrate an ability to find applicable and relevant information security advice from ASD and other applicable Australian Government publications, when presented with a problem.
- demonstrate the technical skills and ability to conduct assessments in accordance with the methodologies and requirements outlined in the IRAP Common Assessment Framework.

## Examination process

The IRAP examination is delivered through multiple-choice questions. There are two (2) categories of questions: IRAP, and ISM.

IRAP examination questions relate to the participant’s understanding of the program and designated assessment methodologies. ISM questions relate to the participant’s knowledge of applying and understanding the intent of a control.

An overall mark of 80% is required to pass the IRAP examination.

### Schedule

The IRAP examination is conducted on the final day of the IRAP training course. Applicants are required to sit their examination at the time prescribed by the invigilator. Deferred examinations are not available.

### Examination conditions

The IRAP examination is ‘open book’ format. Participants are allowed to use the internet and available resources to assist in determining the answers to questions. However, **participants must not share, disseminate, copy, discuss, send or take pictures of the exam or its questions**. Participants caught performing such actions will have their examination or application terminated.

Participants must work individually and without assistance from other parties while answering the questions within the allotted time of 2 hours and 30 minutes.

If participants legitimately require reasonable adjustment to the standard examination protocols, the ASD endorsed training provider will contact ASD IRAP to request the appropriate provisions.

### Examination submission

Examinations are submitted directly to the ASD-endorsed training provider at the end of the allotted examination time. Late submissions will not be accepted.

### Marking

The IRAP examination undergoes a two-stage marking process. In the first stage, the ASD-endorsed training provider will mark the exam. Upon completion of this initial assessment, the results will be sent to ASD IRAP for a stage-two final review.

As per the IRAP Policy and Procedures, examinations will not be returned to applicants and no formal feedback will be provided.

The IRAP examination marking structure includes the application of ‘negative-marking’ for questions that require the selection of multiple answers (denoted by the ‘Select all that apply’). For each incorrect answer selected, participants will lose one mark; with an overall total of zero marks being the minimum possible score for the question. However, participants will not receive a negative mark for not selecting an answer.

**Example:** In a marking structure, C and D are correct, while all other options are incorrect. Total possible marks for this question is 2.

### Notification of results

Examination results will be released by the ASD-endorsed training provider within 30 days. Results are provided via email or telephone using the contact details provided at the time of the examination.

Final results are released as either a Pass or Fail grade. Results will not be published on the cyber.gov.au IRAP website. Results are valid for 12 months. ASD IRAP manages any results appeal, as per the IRAP Policy and Procedures.

### Supplementary examinations

Participants who do not meet the pass mark requirement of 80% may reattempt the IRAP examination after a waiting period of at least 4 months.

An alternative examination is issued to participants resitting the IRAP examination after a failed attempt. It is the responsibility of the participant to schedule an examination resit attempt, in consultation with the ASD-endorsed training provider.

Participants who fail the second examination attempt are required to wait for a period of at least 12 months before reapplying for the course. It is strongly recommended that participants having failed 2 attempts at the examination consider whether they meet the requirements of an IRAP assessor.

### Examination tips

The following tips may be helpful when answering exam questions:

- Read the question carefully, paying attention to key words within the question.
- Avoid making additional assumptions about the question or its context.
- Select the best answer based only on the information provided.
- For multiple selection answers, only select the ones participants are sure of to avoid losing marks.
