## Introduction

Welcome to the IRAP branding and marketing guidelines. This advice has been designed for the IRAP community and consumers, including:

- IRAP assessors
- gateway and cloud service providers

This guide provides instructions on using the IRAP logo, acronym and brand appropriately when promoting yourself as an IRAP assessor, producing assessment reports for clients, or for organisation and accreditation authorities wishing to promote their IRAP status.

Please read and understand these guidelines before using the IRAP acronym, logo or brand on any materials, including marketing, websites, social or traditional media, presentations and assessment reports.

## **Who can use the IRAP brand**

### IRAP assessors

IRAP assessors who are engaged to complete an IRAP assessment are permitted to use the IRAP logo on their assessment reports and promotional materials, strictly as a statement of affiliation and not for any other purposes.

IRAP assessors are responsible for advising their clients on the appropriate promotion of an IRAP assessment. This includes providing non-government clients with advice on correct terminology and use of IRAP branding in any of their post-assessment marketing.

IRAP assessors seeking to promote or represent the IRAP program at a public forum must obtain agreement from ASD IRAP  in advance, to establish that it aligns with ASD’s broader communication strategy  and responsibilities.

IRAP assessors found to be in breach of IRAP branding guidelines may be removed from the public list of assessors until marketing collateral has been removed or revised and approved by ASD IRAP.

### IRAP consumers

IRAP consumers include organisations that are the subject of an IRAP assessment, organisations who use an IRAP assessment report as part of an authorisation package, or those managing an IRAP assessment, such as system owners, program managers and project managers.

The IRAP logo can only be used on assessment reports where an ASD-endorsed IRAP assessor has conducted the assessment.  It must not be used where government agencies or entity assessors are the authorising officer.

Government agencies must not use or publish the IRAP logo for certification and/or accreditation activities, assessment reports, or system security documentation suites.

Non-government organisations who are the subject of an IRAP assessment must follow the guidance provided by their IRAP assessor as to the correct use of the IRAP brand and terminology to promote their IRAP assessment.

### **Any use of the IRAP brand for promotional or commercial purposes must align with this guidance, or otherwise be approved by the ASD IRAP management team.**

Intentional misuse of IRAP branding or fraudulent representation as a registered IRAP assessor may result in forfeiture of entry into the program, and/or enforcement of trademark protections.

## How to use the IRAP brand

### Logo - colour

The IRAP logo is the centrepiece of the program’s brand identity. The logo consists of navy letters, with the dot of the ‘i’ in red and a white center. The font used in the logo is Rezland.

It is crucial to use the logo in a way that maintains its integrity and recognisability. Refrain from stretching, distorting, or altering the logo’s proportions. The logo, in its entirety or in part, must not be cropped or used as a design element in compositions and layouts. It should always be displayed clearly and in accordance with the following guidelines.

### Logo - grey-scale

There is a black on white version available for limited publications printed in grey-scale. This is the only instance when the grey-scale logo may be used. In all other cases, the logo should appear in colour.

### Alternative logo - tear-drop

The IRAP logo should always have sufficient contrast with its background for legibility and accessibility. A white tear-drop background version of the logo is available for use on mid-tone, dark, or busy backgrounds. However, it is recommended to use the colour version on a white background when possible.

### **Logo size and clear space:**

The minimum height for the IRAP logo is 8 mm or 23 pixels.

A clear space must always surround the IRAP logos to separate them from other elements such as headlines, text or imagery. The clear space area for the IRAP logo is equal to the height of the letter ‘a’ (represented by ‘X’), while the clear space for the IRAP tear-drop version is equal to the tear-drop element above the ‘i’ (represented by ‘x’).

When a third-party company uses the IRAP logo on materials such as assessment reports, the IRAP logo should appear after (underneath or to the right of) the company’s logo and as a smaller element.

### Logo misuse examples

To preserve the integrity and clarity of the IRAP brand, it is essential not to modify the IRAP logo in any way or use it in conjunction with conflicting elements.

The following are examples of prohibited uses:

- adding or removing elements from the logo
- changing the colours or proportions of the logo
- distorting or stretching the logo
- using the logo in a manner that implies sponsorship or endorsement by IRAP or the Australian Government
- placing the logo near conflicting elements or messages that could harm the brand’s reputation.

## Marketing IRAP assessments

IRAP assessors do not accredit, certify, endorse, or register systems on behalf of ASD.

Therefore, the IRAP brand must not be connected with any marketing materials that contain this language.

Organisations found to use misleading terminology in relation to the promotion of their IRAP assessment will be required to remove any or rectify such statements from all marketing platforms. This applies to websites and relevant marketing materials that need to be rectified. ASD reserves the right to revoke the use of the IRAP brand if misleading or false claims concerning the program or ASD’s involvement in the certification or authorisation of systems or services are made.

### Marketing example

| **Correct wording** | **Incorrect wording** |
| --- | --- |
| “The platform, which has undergone an Australian Government IRAP Assessment…” | “The platform, which is Australian Government IRAP Certified…” |
| “The following services [list the services] have completed an Assessment by a member of the InfoSec Registered Assessors Program (IRAP) for data classified up to OFFICIAL: Sensitive.” | “The platform has been audited by a member of the InfoSec Registered Assessors Program (IRAP) and is accredited for use in accordance with the ISM and Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF) for data classified up to OFFICIAL: Sensitive.” |

## Assessment report example

Registered ASD-endorsed IRAP assessor may use the IRAP logo on assessment reports they produce.

The IRAP logo may appear once on the bottom of the report cover page. The size of the logo should not overshadow the name of the report and report author. The use of the IRAP logo is strictly and primarily used as a statement of affiliation. This should be reflected in the size and placement of the logo.

‘**This report has been produced by an ASD-endorsed IRAP assessor**’ text may accompany the logo.

## Business card examples

The IRAP logo size must be smaller than the assessors name or company logo. The business card layouts are examples only, to demonstrate how the logo may be used and displayed in proportion to the other design elements.

## Social media / website example

The IRAP logo’s size must be smaller than the assessor name or company logo.

Assessors are subject to the same conditions to use non-misleading terminology to market their services or promote their IRAP assessor status. For any questions or advice regarding IRAP branding or marketing, contact the ASD IRAP team at `asd.irap@defence.gov.au`
