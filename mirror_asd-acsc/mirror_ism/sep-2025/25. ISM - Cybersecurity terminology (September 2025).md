| telemetry | The automatic measurement and transmission of data collected from remote sources. Such data is often used within systems to measure the use, performance and health of one or more functions or devices that make up the system. |
| telephone | A device that is used for point-to-point communication over a distance. This includes digital and IP telephony. |
| telephone system | A system designed primarily for the transmission of voice communications. |
| TOP SECRET area | An area that has been authorised to process, store or communicate TOP SECRET data. Such areas are not necessarily tied to a specific level of security zone. |
| traditional cryptography | Common well studied and understood cryptographic algorithms that existed before the threat of a cryptographically relevant quantum computer existed. |
| Transfer Cross Domain Solution | A system that facilitates the transfer of data, in one or multiple directions (low to high or high to low), between different security domains. |
| transport mode | An IPsec mode that provides a secure connection between two endpoints by encapsulating an IP payload. |
| trustworthy source | A person or system formally identified as being capable of reliably producing data meeting certain defined parameters, such as a maximum data classification and reliably reviewing data produced by others to confirm compliance with certain defined parameters. |
| trustworthy supplier | A supplier that has been verified as trustworthy as part of a cyber supply chain risk management assessment and subsequently recorded on an organisation’s approved supplier list. |
| tunnel mode | An IPsec mode that provides a secure connection between two endpoints by encapsulating an entire IP packet. |
| unprivileged user accounts | User accounts that do not have the capability to modify system configurations, account privileges, event logs or security configurations. An unprivileged user account may belong to a person or a service. |
| unprivileged operating environments | Unprivileged operating environments are those used for activities that do not require privileged access, such as reading emails and browsing the web. |
| unsecured space | An area not certified to the physical security requirements for a Security Zone Two to Security Zone Five area, as defined in the Department of Home Affairs’ [*Protective Security Policy Framework*](https://www.protectivesecurity.gov.au/). |
| untrusted device | Any IT equipment that an organisation does not trust. For example, unknown IT equipment (which might belong to malicious actors), or an uncontrolled personal mobile device of an employee. |
| user | An individual that works for an organisation and is authorised to access a system. |
| user accounts | User accounts include privileged user accounts and unprivileged user accounts. |
| validation | Confirmation that stakeholder requirements for the intended use of operating systems, applications, IT equipment or OT equipment have been met. |
| verification | Confirmation that design or compliance requirements for operating systems, applications, IT equipment or OT equipment have been met. |
| Virtual Local Area Network | Network devices and networked IT equipment grouped logically based on resources, security or business requirements instead of their physical location. |
| virtual patching | A security measure designed to prevent known exploitation attempts against known vulnerabilities in web applications, typically via the use of a network-based intrusion prevention system or a web application firewall. |
| Virtual Private Network | A network that maintains privacy through a tunnelling protocol and security procedures. Virtual Private Networks may use encryption to protect network traffic. |
| virtualisation | Simulation of hardware or software resources. |
| volatile media | A type of media, such as random-access memory, which gradually loses its data when power is removed. |
| vulnerability | A weakness in a system’s security requirements, design, implementation or operation that could be accidentally triggered or intentionally exploited and result in a violation of the system’s security policy. |
| vulnerability assessment | A vulnerability assessment can consist of a documentation-based review of a system’s design, an in-depth hands-on assessment or automated scanning with tools. In each case, the goal is to identify as many vulnerabilities as possible. |
| wear levelling | A technique used in non-volatile flash memory media to prolong the life of the media. As data can be written to and erased from memory blocks a finite number of times, wear-levelling helps to distribute writes evenly across each memory block, thereby decreasing wear and increasing its lifetime. |
| Wi-Fi Protected Access | A protocol designed for communicating data over wireless networks. |
| Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 | A protocol designed to replace the Wi-Fi Protected Access protocol for communicating data over wireless networks. |
| Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 | A protocol designed to replace the WPA2 protocol for communicating data over wireless networks. |
| wireless access point | A device which enables communications between wireless clients. It is typically also the device which connects wired and wireless networks. |
| wireless communications | The transmission of data over a communications path using electromagnetic waves rather than a wired medium. |
| wireless network | A network based on the 802.11 standards. |
| workstation | A stand-alone or networked single-user computer. |
| X11 forwarding | X11, also known as the X Window System, is a basic method of video display used in a variety of operating systems. X11 forwarding allows the video display from one device to be shown on another device. |
