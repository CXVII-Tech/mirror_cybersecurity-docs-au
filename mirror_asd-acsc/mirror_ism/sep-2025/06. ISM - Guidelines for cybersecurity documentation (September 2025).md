## **Development and maintenance of cybersecurity documentation**

### **Cybersecurity strategy**

A cybersecurity strategy articulates an organisation’s vision, guiding principles, objectives and priorities for cybersecurity, typically over a five-year period. In addition, a cybersecurity strategy may also cover an organisation’s threat environment, cybersecurity initiatives or investments the organisation plans to make as part of its cybersecurity program. Without a cybersecurity strategy, an organisation risks failing to adequately plan for and manage security and business risks within their organisation.

***Control: ISM-0039; Revision: 7; Updated: Mar-25; Applicable: NC, OS, P, S, TS; Essential 8: N/A***

*A cybersecurity strategy is developed, implemented and maintained.*

### **Approval of cybersecurity documentation**

If cybersecurity documentation is not reviewed and approved by an appropriate authority, system owners risk failing in their duty to ensure that appropriate controls have been identified and implemented for systems and their operating environments. In doing so, it is important that a system’s security architecture, as outlined within the system security plan and supported by the cybersecurity incident response plan, change and configuration management plan, and continuous monitoring plan, is approved by the system’s authorising officer prior to the development of the system.

***Control: ISM-0047; Revision: 5; Updated: Mar-25; Applicable: NC, OS, P, S, TS; Essential 8: N/A***

*Organisational-level cybersecurity documentation is approved by the chief information security officer while system-specific cybersecurity documentation is approved by the system’s authorising officer.*

***Control: ISM-1739; Revision: 0; Updated: Mar-22; Applicable: NC, OS, P, S, TS; Essential 8: N/A***

*A system’s security architecture is approved prior to the development of the system.*

### **Maintenance of cybersecurity documentation**

Threat environments are dynamic. If cybersecurity documentation is not kept up to date to reflect the current threat environment, policies, processes and procedures may cease to be effective. In such a situation, resources could be devoted to cybersecurity initiatives or investments that have reduced effectiveness or are no longer relevant.

***Control: ISM-0888; Revision: 6; Updated: Mar-25; Applicable: NC, OS, P, S, TS; Essential 8: N/A***

*Cybersecurity documentation is reviewed at least annually and includes a ‘current as at [date]’ or equivalent statement.*

### **Communication of cybersecurity documentation**

It is important that once cybersecurity documentation has been approved, it is published and communicated to all stakeholders. If cybersecurity documentation is not communicated to stakeholders, they will be unaware of what policies and procedures have been implemented for systems.

***Control: ISM-1602; Revision: 1; Updated: Mar-25; Applicable: NC, OS, P, S, TS; Essential 8: N/A***

*Cybersecurity documentation, including notification of subsequent changes, is communicated to all stakeholders.*

## **System-specific cybersecurity documentation**

### **System-specific cybersecurity documentation**

System-specific cybersecurity documentation, such as a system security plan, cybersecurity incident response plan, change and configuration management plan, continuous monitoring plan, security assessment report, and plan of action and milestones, supports the accurate and consistent application of policies, processes and procedures for systems. As such, it is important that they are developed by personnel with a good understanding of business requirements, technologies being used and cybersecurity matters.

System-specific cybersecurity documentation may be presented in a number of formats, including in wikis or other forms of document repositories. Furthermore, depending on the documentation framework used, details common to multiple systems could be consolidated into higher level cybersecurity documentation.

### **System security plan**

The system security plan provides an overview of the system (covering the system’s purpose, the system boundary and how the system is managed) as well as an annex that describes the controls that have been identified and implemented for the system.

There can be many stakeholders involved in developing and maintaining a system security plan. This can include representatives from:

- cybersecurity teams
- project teams who deliver the capability (including contractors)
- support teams who operate and support the capability
- data owners for data processed, stored or communicated by the system
- users for whom the capability is being developed.

***Control: ISM-0041; Revision: 6; Updated: Jun-24; Applicable: NC, OS, P, S, TS; Essential 8: N/A***

*Systems have a system security plan that includes an overview of the system (covering the system’s purpose, the system boundary and how the system is managed) as well as an annex that covers applicable controls from this document and any additional controls that have been identified and implemented.*

### **Cybersecurity incident response plan**

Having a cybersecurity incident response plan ensures that when a cybersecurity incident occurs, a plan is in place to respond appropriately to the situation. In most situations, the aim of the response will be to prevent the cybersecurity incident from escalating, restore any impacted system or data, and preserve any evidence.

***Control: ISM-0043; Revision: 6; Updated: Mar-25; Applicable: NC, OS, P, S, TS; Essential 8: N/A***

*Systems have a cybersecurity incident response plan that covers the following:*

- *guidelines on what constitutes a cybersecurity incident*
- *the types of cybersecurity incidents likely to be encountered and the expected response to each type*
- *how to report cybersecurity incidents, internally to an organisation and externally to relevant authorities*
- *other parties which need to be informed in the event of a cybersecurity incident*
- *the authority, or authorities, responsible for investigating and responding to cybersecurity incidents*
- *the criteria by which an investigation of a cybersecurity incident would be requested from a law enforcement agency, the Australian Signals Directorate or other relevant authority*
- *the steps necessary to ensure the integrity of evidence relating to a cybersecurity incident*
- *system contingency measures or a reference to such details if they are located in a separate document.*

### **Change and configuration management plan**

Having a change and configuration management plan ensures that changes to the configuration of systems can be made in an accountable manner, with appropriate consultation, consideration and approvals, in order to maintain the security of such systems. Furthermore, change management and configuration management processes and procedures provide an opportunity for the security impact of changes to configuration of systems to be considered and, if necessary, additional risk management activities to be undertaken.

***Control: ISM-0912; Revision: 6; Updated: Jun-25; Applicable: NC, OS, P, S, TS; Essential 8: N/A***

*Systems have a change and configuration management plan that includes:*

- *the establishment and maintenance of authorised baseline configurations for systems*
- *what constitutes routine and urgent changes to the configuration of systems*
- *how changes to the configuration of systems will be requested, tracked and documented*
- *who needs to be consulted prior to routine and urgent changes to the configuration of systems*
- *who needs to approve routine and urgent changes to the configuration of systems*
- *who needs to be notified of routine and urgent changes to the configuration of systems*
- *what additional change management and configuration management processes and procedures need to be followed before, during and after routine and urgent changes to the configuration of systems.*

### **Continuous monitoring plan**

A continuous monitoring plan can assist an organisation in proactively identifying, prioritising and responding to vulnerabilities. Measures to monitor and manage vulnerabilities in systems can also provide an organisation with a wealth of valuable information about their exposure to cyberthreats, as well as assisting them to determine security risks associated with the operation of their systems. Undertaking continuous monitoring activities is important as cyberthreats and the effectiveness of controls will change over time.

Three types of continuous monitoring activities are vulnerability scans, vulnerability assessments and penetration tests. A vulnerability scan involves using tools to conduct automated checks for known vulnerabilities whereas a vulnerability assessment typically consists of a review of a system’s architecture or an in-depth hands-on assessment. In each case, the goal is to identify as many vulnerabilities as possible. A penetration test however is designed to exercise real-world scenarios in an attempt to achieve a specific goal, such as compromising critical system components or data. Regardless of the continuous monitoring activities chosen, they should be conducted by suitably skilled personnel independent of the system being assessed. Such personnel can be internal to an organisation or from a third party. This ensures that there is no conflict of interest, perceived or otherwise, and that the activities are undertaken in an objective manner.

***Control: ISM-1163; Revision: 10; Updated: Sep-23; Applicable: NC, OS, P, S, TS; Essential 8: N/A***

*Systems have a continuous monitoring plan that includes:*

- *conducting vulnerability scans for systems at least fortnightly*
- *conducting vulnerability assessments and penetration tests for systems prior to deployment, including prior to deployment of significant changes, and at least annually thereafter*
- *analysing identified vulnerabilities to determine their potential impact*
- *implementing mitigations based on risk, effectiveness and cost.*

### **Security assessment report**

At the conclusion of a security assessment for a system, a security assessment report should be produced by the assessor. This will assist the system owner in performing any initial remediation actions as well as guiding the development of the system’s plan of action and milestones.

***Control: ISM-1563; Revision: 1; Updated: Jun-22; Applicable: NC, OS, P, S, TS; Essential 8: N/A***

*At the conclusion of a security assessment for a system, a security assessment report is produced by the assessor and covers:*

- *the scope of the security assessment*
- *the system’s strengths and weaknesses*
- *security risks associated with the operation of the system*
- *the effectiveness of the implementation of controls*
- *any recommended remediation actions.*

### **Plan of action and milestones**

At the conclusion of a security assessment for a system, and after the production of a security assessment report by the assessor, a plan of action and milestones should be produced by the system owner. This will assist with tracking any of the system’s identified weaknesses and recommended remediation actions identified during the security assessment.

***Control: ISM-1564; Revision: 0; Updated: May-20; Applicable: NC, OS, P, S, TS; Essential 8: N/A***

*At the conclusion of a security assessment for a system, a plan of action and milestones is produced by the system owner.*

### **Further information**

To assist with the development of system-specific cybersecurity documentation, a system security plan annex template, and an equivalent cloud controls matrix template, are available from the Australian Signals Directorate’s [*Information security manual*](https://www.cyber.gov.au/business-government/asds-cyber-security-frameworks/ism) webpage.
