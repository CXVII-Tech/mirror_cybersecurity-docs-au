## **Facilities and systems**

### **Physical access to systems**

The application of the defence-in-depth principle to the protection of systems is enhanced through the use of successive layers of physical security. The first layer of physical security generally being the use of a security zone for facilities that contain systems.

Deployable platforms should also meet physical security requirements. Notably, physical security certification authorities dealing with deployable platforms may have specific requirements that supersede the controls in these guidelines. This may include perimeter controls, building standards and staffing levels. As such, an organisation implementing deployable platforms should contact their physical security certification authority to seek additional guidance.

### **Physical access to servers, network devices and cryptographic equipment**

The second layer of physical security is the use of an additional security zone for a server room or communications room. This is then further supplemented by the use of security containers for the protection of servers, network devices and cryptographic equipment.

*Server rooms, communications rooms and security containers are not left in unsecured states.*

***Control: ISM-1074; Revision: 4; Updated: Dec-24; Applicable: NC, OS, P, S, TS; Essential 8: N/A***

*Keys or equivalent access mechanisms to server rooms, communications rooms and security containers are appropriately controlled.*

### **Physical access to network devices in public areas**

Unprotected network devices in public areas could lead to accidental or deliberate physical damage resulting in an interruption of services. Alternatively, unauthorised access to network devices may allow malicious actors to reset them to factory default settings, thereby removing any controls, or connect directly to them in order to bypass network access controls. Even if access to network devices is not gained by resetting them to factory default settings, it is highly likely that it will cause an interruption of services.

Physical access to network devices can be restricted through the implementation of physical security, such as using enclosures that prevent access to their console ports and factory reset buttons, mounting them on ceilings or behind walls, or securing them in security containers.

***Control: ISM-1296; Revision: 4; Updated: Jun-22; Applicable: NC, OS, P, S, TS; Essential 8: N/A***

*Physical security is implemented to protect network devices in public areas from physical damage or unauthorised access.*

### **Bringing radio frequency and infrared devices into facilities**

Radio frequency (RF) devices, such as mobile devices, wireless keyboards and Bluetooth devices, as well as infrared (IR) devices, can pose a security risk to an organisation, especially when they are capable of recording or transmitting audio or data. In SECRET and TOP SECRET areas, it is important that an organisation understands the security risks associated with the introduction of RF and IR devices and develop, implement, maintain and regularly verify a register of those that have been authorised for use in such environments.

In deciding which RF or IR devices to authorise to be brought into SECRET and TOP SECRET areas, an organisation should consider any mitigating measures already in place, such as whether IR communications would be prevented from travelling outside secured spaces, whether systems of different sensitivities or classifications are used in the same spaces, and if any temporary or permanent method of blocking RF or IR transmissions has been applied to the facility.

***Control: ISM-1543; Revision: 4; Updated: Dec-22; Applicable: S, TS; Essential 8: N/A***

*An authorised RF and IR device register for SECRET and TOP SECRET areas is developed, implemented, maintained and verified on a regular basis.*

***Control: ISM-0225; Revision: 3; Updated: Sep-21; Applicable: S, TS; Essential 8: N/A***

*Unauthorised RF and IR devices are not brought into SECRET and TOP SECRET areas.*

***Control: ISM-0829; Revision: 4; Updated: Mar-19; Applicable: S, TS; Essential 8: N/A***

*Security measures are used to detect and respond to unauthorised RF devices in SECRET and TOP SECRET areas.*

### **Bringing photographic and video recording devices into facilities**

Photographic and video recording devices, such as cameras, video cameras and smart glasses, can pose a security risk to an organisation, especially when they are capable of recording photographs or videos in an inconspicuous manner. In SECRET and TOP SECRET areas, it is important that an organisation understands the security risks associated with the introduction of photographic and video recording devices and develop, implement, maintain and regularly verify a register of those that have been authorised for use in such environments.

***Control: ISM-2069; Revision: 0; Updated: Sep-25; Applicable: S, TS; Essential 8: N/A***

*An authorised photographic and video recording device register for SECRET and TOP SECRET areas is developed, implemented, maintained and verified on a regular basis.*

***Control: ISM-2070; Revision: 0; Updated: Sep-25; Applicable: S, TS; Essential 8: N/A***

*Unauthorised photographic and video recording devices are not brought into SECRET and TOP SECRET areas.*

### **Bringing medical devices into facilities**

Medical devices are devices approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration under the [*Therapeutic Goods (Medical Devices) Regulations 2002*](https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2002B00237/latest/text) for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. The use of medical devices in SECRET and TOP SECRET areas requires active management, similar to RF devices, as they may contain communications functionality that could compromise the physical security of SECRET or TOP SECRET areas or systems within such areas.

***Control: ISM-2007; Revision: 0; Updated: Mar-25; Applicable: S, TS; Essential 8: N/A***

*An authorised medical device register for SECRET and TOP SECRET areas is developed, implemented, maintained and verified on a regular basis.*

***Control: ISM-2008; Revision: 0; Updated: Mar-25; Applicable: S, TS; Essential 8: N/A***

*Medical devices that are authorised to be brought into SECRET and TOP SECRET areas meet, at a minimum, the following criteria:*

- *are listed on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods*
- *have been prescribed by a legally qualified medical practitioner*
- *have been commercially purchased within Australia*
- *do not have inbuilt cellular connectivity*
- *are capable of operating independently of mobile devices*
- *where possible, have Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and other forms of wireless connectivity disabled when operating within SECRET and TOP SECRET areas.*

***Control: ISM-2009; Revision: 0; Updated: Mar-25; Applicable: S, TS; Essential 8: N/A***

*Unauthorised medical devices are not brought into SECRET and TOP SECRET areas.*

### **Preventing observation by unauthorised people**

Without sufficient perimeter security, the inside of a facility is often observable by unauthorised people, such as via direct observation or by using equipment with a telephoto lens. Ensuring systems, in particular workstation displays and keyboards, are not visible through windows, such as via the use of blinds, curtains, privacy films or workstation positioning, will assist in reducing this security risk.

***Control: ISM-0164; Revision: 3; Updated: Dec-21; Applicable: NC, OS, P, S, TS; Essential 8: N/A***

*Unauthorised people are prevented from observing systems, in particular workstation displays and keyboards, within facilities.*

## **IT equipment and media**

### **Securing IT equipment and media**

IT equipment and media needs to be secured when not in use. This can be achieved by implementing one of the following approaches:

- securing IT equipment and media in an appropriate security container
- using IT equipment without hard drives and sanitising memory at shut down
- encrypting hard drives of IT equipment and sanitising memory at shut down
- sanitising memory of IT equipment at shut down and removing and securing any hard drives.

If none of the above approaches are feasible, an organisation may wish to minimise the potential impact of not securing IT equipment when not in use. This can be achieved by preventing sensitive or classified data from being stored on hard drives, storing user profiles and documents on network shares, removing temporary user data at logoff, scrubbing virtual memory at shut down, and sanitising memory at shut down. It should be noted though that there is no guarantee that such measures will always work effectively or will not be bypassed due to unexpected circumstances, such as the loss of power. Therefore, hard drives in such cases will retain their sensitivity or classification for the purposes of reuse, reclassification, declassification, sanitisation, destruction and disposal.
