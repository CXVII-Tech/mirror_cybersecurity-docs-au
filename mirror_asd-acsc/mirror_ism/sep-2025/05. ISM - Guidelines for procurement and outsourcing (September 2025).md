## **Cyber supply chain risk management**

### **Cyber supply chain risk management activities**

Cyber supply chain risk management activities should be conducted during the earliest possible stage of procurement of operating systems, applications, information technology (IT) equipment, operational technology (OT) equipment and services. In particular, an organisation should consider the security risks that may arise as systems, and their components, are being designed, built, stored, delivered, installed, operated, maintained and decommissioned. This includes identifying and managing jurisdictional, governance, privacy and security risks associated with the use of suppliers, such as software developers, IT equipment manufacturers, OT equipment manufacturers, service providers and other organisations involved in distribution channels. For example, outsourced cloud services may be located offshore and subject to lawful and covert data collection without their customers’ knowledge. Additionally, use of offshore services introduces jurisdictional risks as foreign countries’ laws could change with little warning. Finally, foreign owned suppliers operating in Australia may be subject to a foreign government’s lawful access to data belonging to their customers.

When procuring operating systems, applications, IT equipment, OT equipment and services, it is important for an organisation to choose vendors that have demonstrated a commitment to the security of their products. This will assist not only with reducing the potential number of vulnerabilities, but also increasing the likelihood that timely patches, updates or vendor mitigations will be released to remediate any vulnerabilities that are found. Furthermore, it is important for an organisation to choose suppliers that have demonstrated a commitment to transparency and that have a strong track record of maintaining the security of their own systems. In support of this, suppliers should openly provide evidence of their implementation of such commitments, especially when requested by their customers. Finally, a shared responsibly model which clearly defines the responsibilities of suppliers and their customers can be highly beneficial and should be created and shared between both parties.

### **Supplier relationship management**

Developing, implementing and maintaining a supplier relationship management policy can assist an organisation in identifying, prioritising and maintaining strong relationships with suppliers that have demonstrated a commitment to the security of their products and services. In doing so, these suppliers should be recorded on an approved supplier list.

***Control: ISM-1785; Revision: 1; Updated: Dec-22; Applicable: NC, OS, P, S, TS; Essential 8: N/A***

*A supplier relationship management policy is developed, implemented and maintained.*

***Control: ISM-1786; Revision: 1; Updated: Dec-22; Applicable: NC, OS, P, S, TS; Essential 8: N/A***

*An approved supplier list is developed, implemented and maintained.*

### **Sourcing operating systems, applications, IT equipment, OT equipment and services**

In sourcing operating systems, applications, IT equipment, OT equipment and services, an organisation should use trustworthy suppliers as part of cyber supply chain risk management assessments and subsequently recorded on their approved supplier list.

Furthermore, in order to support system availability, an organisation should aim to identify multiple potential suppliers for critical operating systems, applications, IT equipment, OT equipment and services. This coupled with keeping sufficient spares of critical IT equipment and OT equipment in reserve, can assist in mitigating the impact of cyber supply chain disruptions.

***Control: ISM-1789; Revision: 2; Updated: Jun-24; Applicable: NC, OS, P, S, TS; Essential 8: N/A***

*Sufficient spares of critical IT equipment and OT equipment are sourced and kept in reserve.*

### **Delivery of operating systems, applications, IT equipment, OT equipment and services**

As part of the delivery of operating systems, applications, IT equipment, OT equipment and services, measures should be implemented to protect their integrity, noting that such measures will differ depending on whether delivery relates to digital or physical distribution channels. For example, operating systems and applications may benefit from delivery via encrypted communication channels while IT equipment and OT equipment may benefit from tracking and tamper-evident packaging. In doing so, such measures are only beneficial if they are assessed as part of acceptance of products and services. In all cases, suppliers should be consulted on how best to confirm the integrity of their products and services.

While ensuring the integrity of operating systems, applications, IT equipment, OT equipment and services is important, so is ensuring their authenticity. For example, a counterfeit product or service securely delivered is still a counterfeit product or service that may not operate as intended or pose a risk to the security of a system. To assist in identifying counterfeit products and services, suppliers should be consulted on how best to confirm the authenticity of their products and services.

## **Managed services and cloud services**

### **Managed services**

Managed service providers manage the services of an organisation on their behalf. This may include application services, authentication services, backup services, desktop services, enterprise mobility services, gateway services, hosting services, network services, procurement services, security services, support services, and many other business-related services. In doing so, managed service providers may manage services from their customers’ premises or their own premises. In considering security risks associated with managed services, an organisation should consider all managed service providers that have access to their facilities, systems or data.

***Control: ISM-1736; Revision: 1; Updated: Dec-22; Applicable: NC, OS, P, S, TS; Essential 8: N/A***

*A managed service register is developed, implemented, maintained and verified on a regular basis.*

***Control: ISM-1737; Revision: 1; Updated: Sep-22; Applicable: NC, OS, P, S, TS; Essential 8: N/A***

*A managed service register contains the following for each managed service:*

- *managed service provider’s name*
- *managed service’s name*
- *purpose for using the managed service*
- *sensitivity or classification of data involved*
- *due date for the next security assessment of the managed service*
- *contractual arrangements for the managed service*
- *point of contact for users of the managed service*
- *24/7 contact details for the managed service provider.*

### **Assessment of managed service providers**

Managed service providers will need to undergo regular security assessments against the requirements of the [*Information security manual*](https://www.cyber.gov.au/business-government/asds-cyber-security-frameworks/ism) (ISM) to determine their security posture and security risks associated with their use. Following an initial security assessment, subsequent security assessments should focus on any new services that are being offered as well as any ISM or security-related system changes that have occurred since the previous security assessment.

***Control: ISM-1793; Revision: 1; Updated: Dec-24; Applicable: NC, OS, P, S; Essential 8: N/A***

*Managed service providers and their non-classified, OFFICIAL: Sensitive, PROTECTED and SECRET managed services undergo an Infosec Registered Assessor Program (IRAP) assessment, using the latest release of the ISM available prior to the beginning of the IRAP assessment (or a subsequent release), at least every 24 months.*

***Control: ISM-1971; Revision: 0; Updated: Dec-24; Applicable: TS; Essential 8: N/A***

*Managed service providers and their TOP SECRET managed services, including sensitive compartmented information managed services, undergo a security assessment by ASD assessors (or their delegates), using the latest release of the ISM available prior to the beginning of the security assessment (or a subsequent release), at least every 24 months.*

### **Outsourced cloud services**

Outsourcing can be a cost-effective option for providing cloud services, as well as potentially delivering a superior service. However, outsourcing can affect an organisation’s security risk profile. Ultimately, an organisation will still need to decide whether a particular outsourced cloud service represents an acceptable security risk and, if appropriate to do so, authorise it for their own use.

***Control: ISM-1637; Revision: 2; Updated: Dec-22; Applicable: NC, OS, P, S, TS; Essential 8: N/A***

- *contractual arrangements for the cloud service*
- *point of contact for users of the cloud service*
- *24/7 contact details for the cloud service provider.*

***Control: ISM-1529; Revision: 2; Updated: Dec-21; Applicable: S, TS; Essential 8: N/A***

*Only community or private clouds are used for outsourced SECRET and TOP SECRET cloud services.*

### **Assessment of outsourced cloud service providers**

Outsourced cloud service providers and their cloud services will need to undergo regular security assessments against the requirements of the ISM to determine their security posture and security risks associated with their use. Following an initial security assessment, subsequent security assessments should focus on any new cloud services that are being offered as well as any ISM or security-related system changes that have occurred since the previous security assessment.

***Control: ISM-1570; Revision: 2; Updated: Dec-24; Applicable: NC, OS, P, S; Essential 8: N/A***

*Outsourced cloud service providers and their non-classified, OFFICIAL: Sensitive, PROTECTED and SECRET cloud services undergo an IRAP assessment, using the latest release of the ISM available prior to the beginning of the IRAP assessment (or a subsequent release), at least every 24 months.*

***Control: ISM-1972; Revision: 0; Updated: Dec-24; Applicable: TS; Essential 8: N/A***

*Outsourced cloud service providers and their TOP SECRET cloud services, including sensitive compartmented information cloud services, undergo a security assessment by ASD assessors (or their delegates), using the latest release of the ISM available prior to the beginning of the security assessment (or a subsequent release), at least every 24 months.*

### **Contractual security requirements with service providers**

Obligations for protecting data are no different when using a managed service or cloud service than when using an in-house service. As such, contractual arrangements with service providers should address how data entrusted to them, including to any of their subcontractors, will be protected during contractual arrangements and following the completion or termination of such contractual arrangements. However, in some cases an organisation may require managed services or cloud services to be used before all security requirements have been implemented by a service provider. In such cases, contractual arrangements with service providers should include appropriate timeframes for the implementation of security requirements and break clauses if these are not achieved.

In addition, although data ownership resides with service providers’ customers, this can become less clear in some circumstances, such as when legal action is taken and a service provider is asked to provide access to, or data from, their assets. To mitigate the likelihood of data being unavailable or compromised, an organisation can document the types of data and its ownership in contractual arrangements with service providers.

Furthermore, an organisation may make the decision to move from their current service provider for strategic, operational or governance reasons. This may involve changing to another service provider, moving to a different service with the same service provider or moving back to an on-premises solution. In many cases, transferring data and functionality between old and new services or systems will be desired. Service providers can assist their customers by ensuring data is as portable as possible and that as much data can be exported as possible. As such, data should be stored in a documented format, preferably an open standard, noting that undocumented or proprietary formats may make it more difficult for an organisation to perform backup, service migration or service decommissioning activities.

Finally, to ensure that an organisation is given sufficient time to download their data or move to another service provider should a service provider cease offering a particular service, a one-month notification period should be documented in contractual arrangements with service providers.

*A minimum notification period of one month for the cessation of any services by a service provider is documented in contractual arrangements with service providers.*

### **Access to systems by service providers**

To perform their contracted duties, service providers may need to access their customers’ systems. However, without proper controls in place, this could leave systems vulnerable – especially when access occurs from outside of Australian borders. As such, an organisation should ensure that their systems are not accessed or administered by service providers unless such requirements, and associated measures to control such requirements, are documented in contractual arrangements with service providers. In doing so, it is important that sufficient measures are also in place to detect and record any unauthorised access, such as customer support representatives or platform engineers accessing encryption keys. In such cases, the service provider should immediately report the cybersecurity incident to their customer and make available all logs pertaining to the unauthorised access.

***Control: ISM-1073; Revision: 7; Updated: Jun-25; Applicable: NC, OS, P, S, TS; Essential 8: N/A***

*An organisation’s systems are not accessed or administered by a service provider unless a contractual arrangement exists between the organisation and the service provider to do so.*

***Control: ISM-1576; Revision: 4; Updated: Jun-25; Applicable: NC, OS, P, S, TS; Essential 8: N/A***

*If an organisation’s systems are accessed or administered by a service provider in an unauthorised manner, the organisation is immediately notified.*
