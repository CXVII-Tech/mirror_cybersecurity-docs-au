## **Chief information security officer**

### **Breadth of responsibilities**

The role of the chief information security officer (CISO) within an organisation should extend to information technology and operational technology. However, where appropriate and practical to do so, responsibility for operational technology cybersecurity may be delegated by the CISO.

Within this section, the breadth of responsibilities for information technology and operational technology are collectively referenced under the banner of cybersecurity.

### **Required skills and experience**

The role of the CISO requires a combination of technical and soft skills, such as business acumen, leadership, communications and relationship building. Additionally, a CISO should adopt a continuous approach to learning and up-skilling in order to maintain pace with the cyberthreat landscape and new technologies. It is expected that a CISO show innovation and imagination in conceiving and delivering cybersecurity strategies for their organisation.

### **Providing cybersecurity leadership and guidance**

To provide cybersecurity leadership and guidance within an organisation (for information technology and operational technology), it is important that the organisation appoints a CISO.

***Control: ISM-0714; Revision: 7; Updated: Mar-25; Applicable: NC, OS, P, S, TS; Essential 8: N/A***

*A CISO is appointed to provide cybersecurity leadership and guidance for their organisation (covering information technology and operational technology).*

### **Overseeing the cybersecurity program**

The CISO within an organisation is responsible for overseeing their organisation’s cybersecurity program and ensuring compliance with cybersecurity policy, standards, regulations and legislation. They are likely to work with a chief security officer, a chief information officer and other senior executives within their organisation.

***Control: ISM-1478; Revision: 2; Updated: Mar-25; Applicable: NC, OS, P, S, TS; Essential 8: N/A***

***Control: ISM-0724; Revision: 3; Updated: Mar-25; Applicable: NC, OS, P, S, TS; Essential 8: N/A***

*The CISO implements cybersecurity measurement metrics and key performance indicators for their organisation.*

### **Coordinating cybersecurity**

The CISO is responsible for ensuring the alignment of cybersecurity and business objectives within their organisation. To achieve this, they should facilitate communication between cybersecurity and business stakeholders. This includes translating cybersecurity concepts and language into business concepts and language, as well as ensuring that business teams consult with cybersecurity teams to determine appropriate controls when planning new business projects. Additionally, as the CISO is responsible for the development of their organisation’s cybersecurity program, they are best placed to advise projects on the strategic direction of cybersecurity within their organisation.

***Control: ISM-0725; Revision: 4; Updated: Mar-25; Applicable: NC, OS, P, S, TS; Essential 8: N/A***

*The CISO coordinates cybersecurity and business alignment through a cybersecurity steering committee or advisory board, comprising of key cybersecurity and business executives, which meets formally and on a regular basis.*

***Control: ISM-0726; Revision: 3; Updated: Mar-25; Applicable: NC, OS, P, S, TS; Essential 8: N/A***

*The CISO coordinates security risk management activities between cybersecurity and business teams.*

### **Reporting on cybersecurity**

The CISO is responsible for reporting cybersecurity matters to their organisation’s board of directors or executive committee, as well as their organisation’s audit, risk and compliance committee (or equivalent). In doing so, it is important that reporting is done directly by the CISO rather than via other senior executives within their organisation. This ensures reporting remains accurate and free of any conflicts of interest.

Reporting should cover:

- the organisation’s security risk profile
- the status of key systems and any outstanding security risks
- any planned cybersecurity uplift activities
- any recent cybersecurity incidents
- expected returns on cybersecurity investments.

Reporting on cybersecurity matters should be structured by business functions, regions or legal entities and support a consolidated view of an organisation’s security risks.

It is important that the CISO is able to translate security risks into operational risks for their organisation, including financial and legal risks, in order to enable more holistic conversations about their organisation’s risks.

***Control: ISM-0718; Revision: 5; Updated: Mar-25; Applicable: NC, OS, P, S, TS; Essential 8: N/A***

*The CISO regularly reports directly to their organisation’s board of directors or executive committee on cybersecurity matters.*

*The CISO regularly reports directly to their organisation’s audit, risk and compliance committee (or equivalent) on cybersecurity matters.*

### **Overseeing cybersecurity incident response activities**

To ensure the CISO is able to accurately report to their organisation’s board of directors or executive committee on cybersecurity matters, it is important they are fully aware of all cybersecurity incidents within their organisation.

The CISO is also responsible for overseeing their organisation’s response to cybersecurity incidents, including how internal teams respond and communicate with each other during cybersecurity incidents. In the event of a major cybersecurity incident, the CISO should be prepared to step into a crisis management role. They should understand how to bring clarity to the situation and communicate effectively with internal and external stakeholders.
