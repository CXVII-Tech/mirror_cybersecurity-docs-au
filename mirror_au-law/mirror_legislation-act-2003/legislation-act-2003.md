- (e) establishing improved mechanisms for Parliamentary scrutiny of legislative instruments; and
- (ea) automatically repealing spent legislative instruments and notifiable instruments (or provisions of those instruments) that merely provide for the amendment, repeal or commencement of Acts or other instruments; and
- (f) establishing mechanisms to ensure that legislative instruments are periodically reviewed and, if they no longer have a continuing purpose, repealed; and
- (g) enabling regulations to be made under this Act amending or repealing legislative instruments and notifiable instruments in some circumstances.

#### 3A Simplified outline of this Act

===

This Act provides for public access to Commonwealth Acts, legislative instruments and notifiable instruments. The Act also regulates other matters relating to legislative instruments and notifiable instruments.

Acts, legislative instruments and notifiable instruments, compilations and associated documents and information are registered on the Federal Register of Legislation. The public has online access (through an approved website) to authorised versions of registered Acts, instruments and compilations, and to associated documents and information.

The First Parliamentary Counsel maintains the Register and the approved website. The First Parliamentary Counsel is given the power to make editorial changes and some other changes to registered Acts and instruments in preparing compilations, if those changes do not change the effect of the Acts or instruments.

For legislative instruments and notifiable instruments, the Act deals with commencement, interpretation, incorporation of external material by reference and drafting standards.

Rule‑makers for legislative instruments must undertake appropriate and reasonably practicable consultation before the instruments are made. Generally, legislative instruments must be tabled in both Houses of Parliament and are generally subject to disallowance by either House.

Legislative instruments and notifiable instruments (or provisions of those instruments) are automatically repealed if they merely provide for the amendment, repeal or commencement of Acts or other instruments. Legislative instruments are generally repealed automatically (sunsetted) no more than 10 years after being registered.

## Part 2—Key concepts for legislative instruments and notifiable instruments

#### 7 Simplified outline of this Part

===

*What are legislative instruments?*

Generally, the following are legislative instruments:
- an instrument described or declared by a law (including this Act) to be a legislative instrument;
- an instrument registered on the Federal Register of Legislation as a legislative instrument;
- an instrument made under a power delegated by the Parliament that determines the law or alters its content.

However, an instrument is not a legislative instrument if an Act (or a regulation under this Act) so provides.

*What are notifiable instruments?*

Generally, the following are notifiable instruments:
- an instrument described or declared by a law (including this Act or a regulation under this Act) to be a notifiable instrument;
- a commencement instrument;
- an instrument (other than a legislative instrument) that is registered on the Federal Register of Legislation as a notifiable instrument.

Generally, unlike legislative instruments, notifiable instruments are not subject to parliamentary scrutiny, nor are they subject to automatic repeal 10 years after registration.

*Other key concepts*

A legislative instrument or notifiable instrument commences on the day after the instrument is registered, or on another day provided by the instrument. Generally, the instrument does not apply retrospectively if that would adversely affect rights or impose liabilities.

Generally, the same rules apply to the interpretation of legislative instruments and notifiable instruments as apply to the interpretation of Acts. Some special rules also apply to the construction of instruments.

There are restrictions on the extent to which legislative instruments or notifiable instruments can incorporate matters by reference to external documents.

#### 8 Definition of *legislative instrument*

- (1) A `legislative instrument` is an instrument to which subsection (2), (3), (4) or (5) applies.
    - Note: Instruments that can be legislative instruments may be described by their enabling legislation in different ways, for example as regulations, rules, ordinances or determinations.
- *Primary law provides for something to be done by legislative instrument*
- (2) If a primary law gives power to do something by legislative instrument, then:
    - (a) if the thing is done, it must be done by instrument; and
    - (b) that instrument is a `legislative instrument`.
    - Example 1: A primary law provides that “The Minister may, by legislative instrument, determine licence conditions for the purposes of this section.”.
    - Example 2: A primary law provides as follows:
        - “(1) The Chief Executive may, by instrument, determine licence conditions. <br>(2) The Chief Executive may, by instrument, exempt a person from the requirement under this Act to hold a licence. <br>(3) An instrument made by the Chief Executive under subsection (1) or (2) is a legislative instrument.”.
- *Instruments registered on the Federal Register of Legislation*
- (3) An instrument made under a power delegated by the Parliament is a `legislative instrument` if it is registered as a legislative instrument.
    - Note: An instrument made under a power delegated by the Parliament may be a legislative instrument because it is registered as a legislative instrument, whether or not it is a legislative instrument because of another provision of this section.
- *Instruments that determine or alter the law etc.*
- (4) An instrument is a `legislative instrument` if:
    - (a) the instrument is made under a power delegated by the Parliament; and
    - (b) any provision of the instrument:
        - (i) determines the law or alters the content of the law, rather than determining particular cases or particular circumstances in which the law, as set out in an Act or another legislative instrument or provision, is to apply, or is not to apply; and
        - (ii) has the direct or indirect effect of affecting a privilege or interest, imposing an obligation, creating a right, or varying or removing an obligation or right.
- *Instruments declared to be legislative instruments*
- (5) An instrument is a `legislative instrument` if it is declared by section 10 or 57A to be a legislative instrument.
    - Note: Section 10 declares regulations and some other instruments to be legislative instruments. Section 57A declares some instruments to be legislative instruments that were made under a power delegated by the Parliament before 1 January 2005, when the substantive provisions of this Act commenced.
- *Instruments that are not legislative instruments*
- (6) Despite subsections (4) and (5), an instrument is not a `legislative instrument` if it is:
    - (a) declared by an Act not to be a legislative instrument; or
    - (b) prescribed by regulation for the purposes of this paragraph.
- (7) However, subsection (6) does not apply to an instrument that is a legislative instrument under subsection (3) by registration.
- (8) Despite anything else in this section, the following are not legislative instruments, and cannot become legislative instruments under subsection (3) (by being registered as legislative instruments):
    - (a) an instrument that is a notifiable instrument because of subsection 11(1) (primary law gives power to do something by notifiable instrument);
    - (b) a commencement instrument;
    - (c) a compilation of a legislative instrument or notifiable instrument;
    - (d) rules of court or a compilation of rules of court;
    - (e) an explanatory statement for a legislative instrument, or rules of court mentioned in paragraph (d).
    - Note: Rules of court may, however, be registered under this Act, and may be otherwise treated as if they were legislative instruments by their enabling legislation.

#### 9 Inference of legislative character

- *No implication of legislative character (or otherwise)*
- (1) The fact that an instrument is a legislative instrument because of subsection 8(2), (3) or (5) does not imply that the instrument is, or must be, of legislative character (within the ordinary meaning of that term).
- (2) The fact that an instrument is not a legislative instrument because of subsection 8(6) does not imply that the instrument is not, or must not be, of legislative character (within the ordinary meaning of that term).
- *No inference for other instruments*
- (3) In determining whether an instrument made under a provision of a primary law is a legislative instrument under subsection 8(4), no inference may be drawn from the fact that an instrument made under another provision of that primary law, or any other primary law, is a legislative instrument, or is not a legislative instrument.
    - Example: In determining whether a Ministerial direction under a provision of a primary law is a legislative instrument, no inference may be drawn from the fact that a Ministerial direction under another provision of the primary law is described as a legislative instrument.

#### 10 Instruments declared to be legislative instruments

- (1) For the purposes of subsection 8(5), each of the following is a legislative instrument:
    - (a) a regulation or Proclamation (other than a Proclamation that is a commencement instrument) made under a power delegated by the Parliament;
    - (b) a Territory Ordinance covered by subsection (2), or a regulation, rule or by‑law under such an Ordinance;
    - (c) an instrument prescribed by regulation for the purposes of this paragraph;
    - (d) an instrument that includes a provision that amends or repeals another legislative instrument.
    - Note: Commencement instruments, which may be Proclamations, are notifiable instruments: see section 11.
- (2) The following Territory Ordinances are covered by this subsection:
    - (a) an Ordinance made under a power delegated by the Parliament in an Act providing for the government of a non‑self‑governing Territory;
    - (b) an Ordinance made under subsection 12(1) of the *Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910* that has not become an enactment (as defined in the *Australian Capital Territory (Self‑Government) Act 1988*).

#### 11 Definition of *notifiable instrument*

- *What is a notifiable instrument?*
- (1) If a primary law gives power to do something by notifiable instrument, then:
    - (a) if the thing is done, it must be done by instrument; and
    - (b) that instrument is a `notifiable instrument`.
    - Example 1: A primary law provides that “The Minister may, by notifiable instrument, approve a form for the purposes of this section.”.
    - Example 2: A primary law provides as follows:
        - “(1) The Chief Executive may, by instrument, appoint an inspector for the purposes of section [X]. <br>(2) The Chief Executive may, by instrument, approve a form for the purposes of section [Y]. <br>(3) An instrument made by the Chief Executive under subsection (1) or (2) is a notifiable instrument.”.
- (2) Each of the following is a `notifiable instrument`:
    - (a) a commencement instrument for an Act, legislative instrument or notifiable instrument, or for a provision of an Act or such an instrument;
    - (b) an instrument, other than a legislative instrument, prescribed by regulation for the purposes of this paragraph;
    - (c) an instrument, other than a legislative instrument, that is registered as a notifiable instrument, if the instrument is made under a power delegated by the Parliament or another power given by law;
    - (d) an instrument, other than a legislative instrument, that includes a provision that amends or repeals another notifiable instrument.
    - Note: The effect of paragraph (c) is that an instrument (other than a legislative instrument) may be a notifiable instrument because it is registered as a notifiable instrument, even if it would not otherwise be a notifiable instrument because of this section. For a corresponding provision relating to legislative instruments, see subsection 8(3).
- *Modification of the operation of this Act*
- (3) The enabling legislation for a notifiable instrument, or a regulation under this Act in relation to a notifiable instrument, may modify the operation of this Act in relation to the instrument.
    - Example: Such a regulation may provide that a provision of this Act about explanatory statements that is expressed to apply in relation to legislative instruments is also to apply to a particular class of notifiable instruments.
- *Registration to satisfy other publication or notification requirements*
- (4) If an Act or an instrument requires an instrument (other than a legislative instrument), or the particulars of the instrument’s making, to be published or notified in the Gazette or in any other way, then, unless the contrary intention appears, the requirement is taken to be satisfied if the instrument is registered as a notifiable instrument.

#### 12 Commencement of legislative instruments and notifiable instruments

- *When do legislative instruments and notifiable instruments commence?*
- (1) A legislative instrument or a notifiable instrument commences:
    - (a) at the start of the day after the day the instrument is registered; or
    - (b) so far as the instrument provides otherwise—in accordance with such provision.
        - Note: The instrument may provide for its commencement by enabling a commencement instrument to be made: see subsection (5).
- *Retrospective commencement*
- (1A) Despite any principle or rule of common law, a legislative instrument or notifiable instrument may provide that the instrument, or a provision of the instrument, commences before the instrument is registered.
    - Note: The effect of this subsection is to allow legislative and notifiable instruments to commence retrospectively (subject to subsection (2)). This subsection is subject to a contrary provision (see subsection (4)).
- *Retrospective application*
- (2) However, if a legislative instrument or notifiable instrument, or a provision of such an instrument, commences before the instrument is registered, the instrument or provision does not apply in relation to a person (other than the Commonwealth or an authority of the Commonwealth) to the extent that as a result of that commencement:
    - (a) the person’s rights as at the time the instrument is registered would be affected so as to disadvantage the person; or
    - (b) liabilities would be imposed on the person in respect of anything done or omitted to be done before the instrument is registered.
- *Retrospective commencement or application subject to contrary provision*
- (4) The effect of subsection (1A) or (2) in relation to an instrument is subject to any contrary provision in an Act.
- *Commencement instruments*
- (5) Without limiting paragraph (1)(b), for the purposes of that paragraph, a legislative instrument or notifiable instrument may authorise the making of a commencement instrument in relation to the legislative instrument or notifiable instrument.

#### 13 Construction of legislative instruments and notifiable instruments

- (1) If enabling legislation confers on a person the power to make a legislative instrument or notifiable instrument, then, unless the contrary intention appears:
    - (a) the *Acts Interpretation Act 1901* applies to any instrument so made as if it were an Act and as if each provision of the instrument were a section of an Act; and
    - (b) expressions used in any instrument so made have the same meaning as in the enabling legislation as in force from time to time; and
    - (c) any instrument so made is to be read and construed subject to the enabling legislation as in force from time to time, and so as not to exceed the power of the person to make the instrument.
- (2) If the making of a legislative instrument or notifiable instrument would, apart from this subsection, be construed as being in excess of the power to make the instrument, it is to be taken to be a valid instrument to the extent to which it is not in excess of that power.
- (3) If enabling legislation confers on a person the power to make a legislative instrument or notifiable instrument:
    - (a) specifying, declaring or prescribing a matter; or
    - (b) doing anything in relation to a matter;
    
    then, in exercising the power, the person may identify the matter by referring to a class or classes of matters.
- (4) For the purposes of subsection (3), `matter` includes thing, person and animal.
- (5) The amendment of a legislative instrument or notifiable instrument by an Act does not prevent the instrument, as so amended, from being amended or repealed by a person who is currently authorised under the enabling legislation for the instrument to make instruments of the same kind.
    - Note: This section has a parallel, in relation to instruments other than legislative instruments or notifiable instruments, in subsection 33(3AB) and section 46 of the *Acts Interpretation Act 1901*.

#### 14 Prescribing matters by reference to other instruments

- (1) If enabling legislation authorises or requires provision to be made in relation to any matter by a legislative instrument or notifiable instrument, the instrument may, unless the contrary intention appears, make provision in relation to that matter:
    - (a) by applying, adopting or incorporating, with or without modification, any of the following, as in force at a particular time or as in force from time to time:
        - (i) the provisions of an Act;
        - (ii) the provisions of a legislative instrument covered by subsection (3);
        - (iii) the provisions of rules of court; or
    - (b) subject to subsection (2), by applying, adopting or incorporating, with or without modification, any matter contained in any other instrument or writing as in force or existing at:
        - (i) the time the first‑mentioned instrument commences; or
        - (ii) a time before the first‑mentioned instrument commences (whether or not the other instrument is still in force, or the other writing still exists, at the time the first‑mentioned instrument commences).
- (2) Unless the contrary intention appears, the legislative instrument or notifiable instrument may not make provision in relation to a matter by applying, adopting or incorporating any matter contained in an instrument or other writing as in force or existing from time to time.
- (3) The following legislative instruments are covered by this subsection:
    - (a) disallowable legislative instruments;
    - (b) legislative instruments that were disallowable under the *Acts Interpretation Act 1901* or any other Act at any time before 1 January 2005.
    - Note: The substantive provisions of this Act commenced on 1 January 2005.
- *Forms*
- (4) If a legislative instrument or notifiable instrument provides for a form to be used, this section does not apply in relation to the form.
    - Note: This section has a parallel, in relation to instruments that are not legislative instruments, in section 46AA of the *Acts Interpretation Act 1901*.

#### 15B Federal Register of Legislation—complete record of registered laws

The Federal Register of Legislation is, for all purposes, taken to be a complete and accurate record of all registered Acts, legislative instruments and notifiable instruments.
- Note: For authorised versions of Acts, legislative instruments, notifiable instruments and compilations, and judicial notice of authorised versions, see Part 3 of this Chapter.

#### 15C Federal Register of Legislation—access to registered material on approved website

The First Parliamentary Counsel must ensure that registered Acts, legislative instruments, notifiable instruments and compilations, and other registered documents, are available to the public on a website (an `approved website`) prescribed by the rules.

#### 15D Federal Register of Legislation—rectification of Register

- (1) If:
    - (a) the First Parliamentary Counsel becomes aware that the Register contains an error; and
    - (b) the error is that:
        - (i) for an Act as assented to—the text of the Act as it appears in the Register is not the same as the text of the Act as assented to; or
        - (ii) for a legislative instrument or notifiable instrument as made by the rule‑maker—the text of the instrument as it appears in the Register is not the same as the text of the instrument as made by the rule‑maker; or
        - (iii) for a compilation—the compilation as it appears in the Register does not represent the state of the law that it purports to represent; or
        - (iv) for any other document on the Register—the text of the document as it appears in the Register is not the same as the text of the original document;
    
    the First Parliamentary Counsel must arrange for the error in the Register to be rectified as soon as possible.
    - Note: A disallowable legislative instrument may be required to be re‑tabled in the Parliament as a result of the rectification (see section 15DA).
- (2) The First Parliamentary Counsel must include in the Register a statement that the rectification has been made, and a brief outline of the rectification in general terms.
- (3) The rectification:
    - (a) does not affect any right or privilege that was acquired, or that accrued, because of reliance on the content of the Register before the rectification was made; and
    - (b) does not impose or increase any obligation or liability that was incurred before the rectification was made.
- *Rectification does not affect time of registration*
- (4) To avoid doubt, the rectification of an error under subsection (1) in relation to an instrument does not affect the time at which the instrument is taken to have been registered.
    - Note: For example, subsection (1) does not affect the commencement of an instrument that is expressed to commence on the day after registration.

#### 15DA Requirement for re‑tabling and new disallowance period after rectification of Register

- (1) This section applies if:
    - (a) the First Parliamentary Counsel rectifies an error in the Register referred to in subparagraph 15D(1)(b)(ii); and
    - (b) the rectification results in a version (the `originally tabled version`) of a disallowable legislative instrument that was previously registered being replaced by another version (the `correct version`) of the instrument; and
    - (c) at the time of the rectification, the originally tabled version of the instrument has been laid before either or both Houses of the Parliament under subsection 38(1).
- *Requirement for re‑tabling*
- (2) The First Parliamentary Counsel must arrange for a copy of the correct version of the instrument to be delivered to each House of the Parliament to be laid before each House within 6 sitting days of that House after the rectification.
    - Note: The re‑tabling of the instrument does not affect any disallowance of the instrument. In all other cases, the re‑tabling of the instrument starts a new disallowance period (see subsections (3) and (4)).
- *Application of new disallowance period*
- (3) The following applies (subject to subsection (4)) for the purposes of this Act:
    - (a) the instrument is taken to have been delivered to, and laid before, a House of the Parliament under subsection 38(1) when the instrument is delivered to, and laid before, that House under subsection (2) of this section (except for the purposes of subsection 39(2));
    - (b) the instrument becomes subject to disallowance under Part 2 of Chapter 3;
    - (c) section 46 applies as if the instrument had been registered at the time of the rectification;
    - (d) if the disallowance period for the originally tabled version has ended—any repeal of the instrument or a provision of the instrument under section 48A or 48C is taken not to have occurred;
    - (e) if:
        - (i) a notice of motion to disallow the instrument or a provision of the instrument has been given in a House of the Parliament; and
        - (ii) the notice has not been withdrawn; and
        - (iii) the motion has not been disposed of;
        
        at the time the correct version of the instrument is laid before a House as mentioned in subsection (2)—that notice of motion is taken to have been given in that House on the sitting day of that House after the correct version of the instrument is laid before that House;
    - (f) if a provision of the instrument (but not the whole instrument) has previously been disallowed—the laying before a House of the Parliament as mentioned in subsection (2) does not affect the previous disallowance of the provision.
- (4) Subsection (3) does not apply in relation to an instrument if, at the time the instrument is delivered to a House of the Parliament under subsection (2), the instrument has been disallowed.
- *Section does not affect time of registration*
- (5) To avoid doubt, the laying before a House of the Parliament of an instrument as mentioned in subsection (2) does not affect the time at which the instrument is taken to have been registered (except as provided by paragraph (3)(c)).

#### 15E Federal Register of Legislation—keeping the Register

The rules may provide for, or in relation to, the following:
- (a) keeping the Federal Register of Legislation;

# Chapter 3—Legislative instruments and notifiable instruments

## Part 1—Drafting standards and consultation

#### 15ZC Simplified outline of this Part

===

The First Parliamentary Counsel is responsible for promoting the legal effectiveness, clarity and intelligibility of legislative instruments and notifiable instruments.

Before a legislative instrument is made, the rule‑maker must be satisfied that any consultation that is appropriate and reasonably practicable has taken place.

===

#### 16 Measures to achieve high drafting standards for legislative instruments and notifiable instruments

- (1) To encourage high standards in the drafting of legislative instruments and notifiable instruments, the First Parliamentary Counsel must cause steps to be taken to promote the legal effectiveness, clarity, and intelligibility to anticipated users, of legislative instruments and notifiable instruments.
- (2) The steps referred to in subsection (1) may include, but are not limited to:
    - (a) undertaking or supervising the drafting of legislative instruments and notifiable instruments; and
    - (b) scrutinising preliminary drafts of legislative instruments and notifiable instruments; and
    - (c) providing advice concerning the drafting of legislative instruments and notifiable instruments; and
    - (d) providing training in drafting and matters related to drafting to officers and employees of Departments or other agencies; and
    - (e) arranging the temporary secondment to Departments or other agencies of APS employees performing duties in the Office of Parliamentary Counsel; and
    - (f) providing drafting precedents to officers and employees of Departments or other agencies.
- (3) The First Parliamentary Counsel must also cause steps to be taken:
    - (a) to prevent the use of gender‑specific language in legislative instruments and notifiable instruments in circumstances where it is not necessary to identify persons by their sex; and
    - (b) to advise rule‑makers for registered legislative instruments or notifiable instruments if those instruments use gender‑specific language in those circumstances; and
    - (c) to notify both Houses of the Parliament about any occasion when a rule‑maker is advised under paragraph (b).

#### 17 Rule‑makers should consult before making legislative instruments

- (1) Before a legislative instrument is made, the rule‑maker must be satisfied that there has been undertaken any consultation that is:
    - (a) considered by the rule‑maker to be appropriate; and
    - (b) reasonably practicable to undertake.
- (2) In determining whether any consultation that was undertaken is appropriate, the rule‑maker may have regard to any relevant matter, including the extent to which the consultation:
    - (a) drew on the knowledge of persons having expertise in fields relevant to the proposed instrument; and
    - (b) ensured that persons likely to be affected by the proposed instrument had an adequate opportunity to comment on its proposed content.
- (3) Without limiting, by implication, the form that consultation referred to in subsection (1) might take, such consultation could involve notification, either directly or by advertisement, of bodies that, or of organisations representative of persons who, are likely to be affected by the proposed instrument. Such notification could invite submissions to be made by a specified date or might invite participation in public hearings to be held concerning the proposed instrument.
    - Note: Under subsection 15J(2), an explanatory statement relating to a legislative instrument must include a description of consultation undertaken or, if there was no consultation, an explanation for its absence.

#### 19 Consequence of failure to consult

The fact that consultation does not occur does not affect the validity or enforceability of a legislative instrument.

## Part 2—Parliamentary scrutiny of legislative instruments

#### 36 Simplified outline of this Part

===

The Office of Parliamentary Counsel must generally deliver a legislative instrument for laying before each House of the Parliament within 6 sitting days of that House after the instrument is registered (with the instrument’s registered explanatory statement, if applicable).

A legislative instrument (or a provision) may be disallowed by either House within a certain time after the instrument is tabled. A legislative instrument is taken to be repealed if it is disallowed. Some legislative instruments are required to be tabled in Parliament, but are not subject to disallowance.

===

#### 37 The purpose of the Part

The purpose of this Part is to facilitate the scrutiny by the Parliament of registered legislative instruments and to set out the circumstances and manner in which such instruments, or provisions of such instruments, may be disallowed, as well as the consequences of such disallowance.
- Note: Some legislative instruments are not disallowable (see section 44).

#### 38 Tabling of legislative instruments

- (1) The Office of Parliamentary Counsel must arrange for a copy of each registered legislative instrument to be delivered to each House of the Parliament to be laid before each House within 6 sitting days of that House after the registration of the instrument.
- (3) If a copy of a legislative instrument is not laid before each House of the Parliament in accordance with this section, the legislative instrument is repealed immediately after the last day for it to be so laid.

#### 39 Tabling of explanatory statements

- (1) If an explanatory statement for a legislative instrument is registered, the Office of Parliamentary Counsel must arrange for a copy of the explanatory statement to be delivered to each House of the Parliament, to be laid before each House.
- (2) The delivery to each House of the Parliament must be arranged:
    - (a) in the case of an initial explanatory statement:
        - (i) if practicable, at the same time as a copy of the instrument is delivered to that House under section 38; or
        - (ii) in any other case—within 6 sitting days of that House after registration of the explanatory statement; or
    - (b) in the case of a supplementary explanatory statement or replacement explanatory statement—within 6 sitting days of that House after registration of the explanatory statement.
- (3) If the initial explanatory statement for a legislative instrument is lodged by the rule‑maker for registration too late for it to be delivered to a House of the Parliament at the same time as a copy of the instrument, the rule‑maker must, as soon as possible, deliver to that House a written statement explaining the lateness of lodgement.
- (4) If a replacement explanatory statement replacing an initial explanatory statement is registered before the initial explanatory statement is delivered to each House of the Parliament under subsection (1):
    - (a) this section stops applying to the initial explanatory statement; and
    - (b) this section applies to the replacement explanatory statement as if it were the initial explanatory statement.
    - Note: For initial explanatory statements and supplementary and replacement explanatory statements, see section 15J.

#### 40 Regulations may specify manner of delivery of certain documents

The regulations may specify the manner, which may include delivery by an electronic means, by which documents required to be laid before a House of the Parliament in accordance with section 38 or 39 may be delivered to that House for that purpose.

#### 41 Incorporated material may be required to be made available

A House of the Parliament may, at any time while a legislative instrument is subject to disallowance, require any document incorporated by reference in the instrument to be made available for inspection by that House:
- (a) at a place acceptable to the House; and
- (b) at a time specified by the House.

#### 42 Disallowance of legislative instruments

- (1) If:
    - (a) notice of a motion to disallow a legislative instrument or a provision of a legislative instrument is given in a House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House beginning on the first sitting day after a copy of the instrument was laid before that House; and
    - (b) within 15 sitting days of that House beginning on the first sitting day after the giving of that notice, the House passes a resolution, in pursuance of the motion, disallowing the instrument or provision;
    
    the instrument or provision so disallowed is repealed immediately after the passing of that resolution.
- (2) If:
    - (a) notice of a motion to disallow a legislative instrument or a provision of a legislative instrument is given in a House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House beginning on the first sitting day after a copy of the instrument was laid before that House; and
    - (b) at the end of 15 sitting days of that House beginning on the first sitting day after the giving of that notice of motion:
        - (i) the notice has not been withdrawn and the motion has not been called on; or
        - (ii) the motion has been called on, moved and (where relevant) seconded and has not been withdrawn or otherwise disposed of;
        
        the instrument or provision specified in the motion is then taken to have been disallowed and is repealed at that time.
- (3) If:

        - (i) the notice has not been withdrawn and the motion has not been called on; or
        - (ii) the motion has been called on, moved and (where relevant) seconded and has not been withdrawn or otherwise disposed of;
    
    the legislative instrument is taken, for the purposes of subsections (1) and (2), to have been laid before the first‑mentioned House on the first sitting day of that first‑mentioned House after the dissolution, expiry or prorogation, as the case may be.
    

#### 44 Legislative instruments that are not subject to disallowance

    the instrument, law or provision repealed by the repealing instrument or repealing provision revives from the repeal time as if the repealing instrument or repealing provision had not been made.
- (3) Subsection (2) does not have the effect of reviving a legislative instrument, law or provision if, before the date when it would have been revived, Part 4 (sunsetting of legislative instruments) would have repealed it had it not already been repealed by the repealing instrument or the repealing provision.

#### 46 Legislative instruments not to be remade while required to be tabled

- (1) If a legislative instrument (the `original legislative instrument`) has been registered, no legislative instrument the same in substance as the original legislative instrument is to be made during the period defined by subsection (2) unless both Houses of the Parliament by resolution approve the making of an instrument the same in substance as the original legislative instrument.

#### 48D Automatic repeal of commencement provisions

- (1) Subject to subsection (2), this section repeals a provision (a `commencement provision`) of a legislative instrument or notifiable instrument, other than a commencement instrument, if the commencement provision provides solely for the commencement of one of the following (a `primary law`) or a provision (a `primary provision`) of one of the following:
    - (a) the instrument;
    - (b) an Act;
    - (c) another instrument that is a legislative instrument or notifiable instrument.
- *Time of repeal*
- (2) The repeal of the commencement provision by this section happens immediately after the latest of the following events occurs, unless the commencement provision has been repealed earlier by subsection 38(3) or 42(1) or (2):
    - (aa) if the commencement provision is in a disallowable legislative instrument—the end of the last day on which the instrument or a provision of the instrument may be disallowed in a House of the Parliament;
    - (a) if the commencement provision is in any legislative instrument or notifiable instrument—whichever of the following is applicable:
        - (i) the commencement (or the last commencement) the commencement provision provides for;
        - (ii) if the commencement provision provides for the commencement of a primary law, and the last of the provisions of the primary law that have not commenced are repealed—that repeal;
        - (iii) if the commencement provision provides for the commencement of a primary law, and the primary law (or the last of the provisions of the primary law) cannot commence because of the occurrence of an event—the occurrence of that event;
        - (iv) if the commencement provision provides for the commencement of a primary provision, and the primary provision is repealed, or cannot commence because of the occurrence of an event—that repeal, or the occurrence of that event;
    - (b) if the commencement provision is in a legislative instrument to which section 42 does not apply or is in a notifiable instrument—the registration of the legislative instrument or notifiable instrument.
- *Effect of repeal*
- (3) The repeal of the provision by this section does not affect any commencement the provision provides for. This does not limit the effect of section 7 of the *Acts Interpretation Act 1901* as it applies in relation to the repeal of the provision by this section because of section 13 of this Act.

### Division 2—Repeal by regulations

#### 48E Regulations may repeal instruments or provisions no longer required

- (1) The regulations may repeal a legislative instrument or notifiable instrument or a provision of a legislative instrument or notifiable instrument.
- (2) Before the Governor‑General makes a regulation for the purposes of subsection (1), the Attorney‑General must be satisfied that the legislative instrument or notifiable instrument or provision to be repealed is spent or is no longer required.

## Part 4—Sunsetting of legislative instruments

#### 48F Simplified outline of this Part

===

Legislative instruments are automatically repealed after a fixed period of time (subject to some exceptions). The automatic repeal is called sunsetting.

Generally, legislative instruments sunset on the first 1 April or 1 October on or after the tenth anniversary of their registration. The Attorney‑General may (by legislative instrument) defer sunsetting in some circumstances.

The Attorney‑General must arrange for the tabling in each House of Parliament of a list of legislative instruments that are due for sunsetting on the same day. The Office of Parliamentary Counsel must then arrange for each rule‑maker to be given a copy of the list.

Either House of Parliament may resolve to continue in force a legislative instrument that would otherwise sunset.

A legislative instrument does not sunset if this Act or a regulation under this Act, or another Act, provides or has the effect that this Part does not apply to the instrument.

===

#### 49 The purpose of the Part

The purpose of this Part is to ensure that legislative instruments are kept up to date and only remain in force for so long as they are needed.
- Note: Section 54 provides that certain instruments are exempted from the operation of this Part.

#### 50 Sunsetting

- (1) This subsection repeals a legislative instrument on the first 1 April or 1 October falling on or after the tenth anniversary of registration of the instrument, unless the instrument was registered on 1 January 2005.
- (2) This subsection repeals a legislative instrument on the day worked out using the table if the instrument was registered on 1 January 2005.

| 11 | 2003 or 2004 | 1 April 2020 |

- *Relationship with other provisions*
- (3) This section has effect subject to Part 3 (repeal of spent legislative instruments, notifiable instruments and provisions) and sections 51, 51A, 53 and 54.
    - Note: A legislative instrument may be repealed under Part 3 before it could be repealed by this section. Section 51 or 51A may repeal a legislative instrument at a time different from the time when it would be repealed by this section. Sections 53 and 54 may prevent a legislative instrument from being repealed by this section.

#### 51 Attorney‑General may defer sunsetting in certain circumstances

- (1) If:
    - (a) a legislative instrument would (apart from this section) be repealed by section 50 or 51A on a particular day (the `sunsetting day`); and
    - (b) the Attorney‑General is satisfied, on written application by the rule‑maker:
        - (i) that the instrument would (apart from the operation of this Part) be likely to cease to be in force within 24 months after the sunsetting day; or
        - (ii) that an instrument proposed to be made in substitution for the instrument will not be able to be completed before the sunsetting day for reasons that the rule‑maker could not have foreseen and avoided or because the dissolution or expiration of the House of Representatives or the prorogation of the Parliament renders it inappropriate to make a replacement instrument before a new government is formed; or
        - (iii) that the Attorney‑General has approved this Part not applying to the instrument;
    
    then:
    - (c) the Attorney‑General may issue a certificate providing that the first‑mentioned instrument is repealed by this section on a 1 April or 1 October that is on or before the second anniversary of the sunsetting day and that is specified in the certificate; and
    - (d) if the Attorney‑General issues the certificate, the first‑mentioned instrument is repealed by this section on the specified day instead of the sunsetting day, unless the instrument has been repealed earlier.
- (3) A certificate issued under paragraph (1)(c) is a legislative instrument.
- (4) Section 42 does not apply to a certificate issued under paragraph (1)(c) if the day specified in the certificate is on or before the first anniversary of the sunsetting day.
- (5) The explanatory statement for a certificate issued under paragraph (1)(c) must include a statement of the reasons for the issue of the certificate.

#### 51A Attorney‑General may align sunsetting of instruments to be reviewed together

- (1) The Attorney‑General may by legislative instrument (the `sunset‑altering instrument`) declare that 2 or more other legislative instruments (the `instruments to be reviewed`) are repealed by this section on a single specified day, if he or she is satisfied, on application by the rule‑maker of the instruments to be reviewed, that:
    - (a) all the instruments to be reviewed:
        - (i) would, apart from this section, be repealed by section 50 or 51; and
        - (ii) are or will be the subject of a single review; and
    - (b) the making of the declaration will facilitate the undertaking of the review or the implementation of its findings.
- (2) The day specified in the sunset‑altering instrument:
    - (a) must be 1 April or 1 October of a year; and
    - (b) must be not more than 5 years after the earliest day on which any of the instruments to be reviewed would be repealed by section 50 or 51 apart from this section; and
    - (c) may be the same as, or different from, any of the days on which any of the instruments to be reviewed would be repealed by section 50 or 51 apart from this section.
- (3) The sunset‑altering instrument has effect according to its terms (subject to Part 2 (parliamentary scrutiny of legislative instruments), and to section 53 operating on the instruments to be reviewed).
- (4) The explanatory statement for the sunset‑altering instrument must include a statement of the reasons for the making of the instrument.

#### 52 Attorney‑General must lay lists of instruments due for sunsetting before each House of the Parliament

- (1) In this section:
    - `list tabling day`, in relation to a sunsetting day and to a House of the Parliament, means the first sitting day of that House occurring within 18 months before that sunsetting day.
    - `sunsetting day` means the first possible day on which any legislative instrument will be repealed by this Part and each 1 April and 1 October occurring after that day.
- (2) The Attorney‑General must arrange for the laying before each House of the Parliament, on each list tabling day in relation to that House, of a list of legislative instruments that will be repealed by section 50, 51 or 51A on the sunsetting day to which that list tabling day relates.
- (3) As soon as practicable after the laying before either House of the Parliament of a list in accordance with subsection (2), the Office of Parliamentary Counsel must arrange for a copy of that list to be provided to the rule‑maker responsible for each legislative instrument appearing on the list.
- (4) If subsection (2) requires the Attorney‑General to arrange for the laying of a list of the kind referred to in that subsection before the Houses of the Parliament on different days, subsection (3) need only be complied with in relation to the earlier of those days.

#### 53 Resolution that instrument continue in force

- (1) A legislative instrument that would otherwise be repealed on a day (the `repeal day`) by section 50, 51 or 51A continues in force, despite those sections, if:
    - (a) the instrument is mentioned in:
        - (i) a copy of a certificate under section 51 that is laid before a House of the Parliament in accordance with section 38; or
        - (ii) a list laid before a House of the Parliament under section 52; and
    - (b) the House indicates, by resolution passed before the repeal day, that the instrument should continue in force.
- (2) The legislative instrument continues in force, subject to:
    - (a) sections 50, 51 and 51A, which apply to it after the passage of the resolution as if it were registered on the day on which it would have been repealed by section 50, 51 or 51A apart from this section; and
    - (b) any later instrument amending or repealing it.
    - Note: The legislative instrument is not required to be tabled again, and is not liable to disallowance again.

#### 54 Instruments to which this Part does not apply

- (1) This Part does not apply in relation to a legislative instrument if the enabling legislation for the instrument (not being the *Corporations Act 2001*):
    - (a) facilitates the establishment or operation of an intergovernmental body or scheme involving the Commonwealth and one or more States or Territories; and
    - (b) authorises the instrument to be made by the body or for the purposes of the body or scheme.
- (2) This Part does not apply in relation to a legislative instrument if:
    - (a) an Act provides, or has the effect, that this Part does not apply in relation to the instrument; or
    - (b) the legislative instrument is prescribed by regulation for the purposes of this paragraph; or
    - (c) the legislative instrument is a regulation made for the purposes of:
        - (i) paragraph 8(6)(b) (which covers instruments that are not legislative instruments); or
        - (ii) paragraph 10(1)(c) (which covers instruments that are legislative instruments); or
        - (iii) paragraph 11(2)(b) (which covers instruments that are notifiable instruments); or
        - (iv) paragraph 44(2)(b) (which covers instruments that are not subject to disallowance); or
        - (v) paragraph (b) of this subsection.
- (3) Prescribing a kind of instrument by regulation for the purposes of paragraph (2)(b) does not imply that every instrument of that kind is a legislative instrument.

- *Other publication or notification requirements in addition to registration*
- (2) Subsection (3) applies if a primary law as enacted or made, or as amended, on or after 1 January 2005 requires a legislative instrument made under that law or other enabling legislation, or particulars of the making of the instrument, to be published or notified otherwise than in the Gazette.

    - (d) the disallowance or non‑disallowance of that document, in accordance with this Act, of a document that is laid before the Houses of the Parliament in accordance with this Act;
    
    as if the circumstance referred to in paragraph (c) or (d) were a circumstance referred to in paragraph (a) or (b).
- (4) If provisions in force immediately before 1 January 2005 in relation to a document that is a legislative instrument:
    - (a) require the document to be laid before the Houses of the Parliament; and
    - (b) specify particular requirements to be complied with before, or at the same time as, that document is so laid;
    
    those provisions continue to have effect, on and after 1 January 2005, as if they were requirements to be complied with before, or at the same time as, the document is laid before the Houses of the Parliament in accordance with this Act.
    - Note: This subsection applies, for example, if the enabling legislation in respect of a legislative instrument required that a report concerning any such instrument be prepared and laid before the Parliament at the same time as the instrument is so laid.
- (5) If particular disallowance provisions of the kind referred to in subsection (2) are prescribed as provisions to which subsection (2) does not apply, then those provisions continue to apply, on and after 1 January 2005, despite the provisions to different effect in sections 42 to 48.
    - Note: The substantive provisions of this Act commenced on 1 January 2005.
